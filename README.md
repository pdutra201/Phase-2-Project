# Phase 2 Project (Clothing Store)

## Project Description
The application was created with the purpose of having a user set their measurements and clothing sizes 
and showing the availible clothes for sale to match. It also allows for clothes to be added into the list and deleted, which will be later controlled by an admin account. React allowed for easy code application when implimenting the route and bootstrap provided a nice style to list.

## Instructions for Setup
1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Make sure the render json server is up and running
3. npm start to view the application

## Functionality
1. the Sort route should be the home page
2. Sort should have the user select a shirt size and pant size
3. the submit button should navigate the user to the ClothesList route
4. the ClothesList route will display the list of clothes acording to what is selected in the sort and what is availible
    in the json server
5. Delete should remove the item from the page as well as from the server
6. the NewItem route should allow the user to input a name, price, image url, and size.
7. once submited the input fields should reset, and the item be added to the list both on live on the app and to the server.
